In this section our main aim is to assign specified (previously bought) domain name to our .NET Core web application
as well as to configure SSL certificate for it.
What is domain name?
\begin{center}
    \textbf{Domain name} -- is a string of text that maps to a numeric IP address, used to access a website
    from client software~\cite{DomanNameCloudflare}.
    The actual address of a website is a complex numerical IP address (e.g.\ 103.21.244.0), but thanks to DNS,
    users are able to enter human-friendly domain names and be routed to the websites they are looking for.
\end{center}
For instance, the domain name can be bought on the one of the following resources
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.name.com/}{\texttt{https://www.name.com}}
    \item \href{https://www.namecheap.com/}{\texttt{https://www.namecheap.com}}
    \item \href{https://get.tech/}{\texttt{https://get.tech}}
\end{itemize}
