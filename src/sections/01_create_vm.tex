Firstly, it is necessary to create a virtual machine (unexpectedly) where deployment to be hosted on.
In this guide is considered free virtual machine of type \texttt{Standard B1ms (1 vcpu, 2 GiB memory)}
with Ubuntu 20.04 operating system.
Definitely it won't be considered step by step creation in this document, however required VM parameter are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Size: \texttt{Standard B1ms (1 vcpu, 2 GiB memory)}
    \item OS: \texttt{Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS - Gen2}
    \item Availability options: \texttt{No infrastructure required}
    \item Authentication type: \texttt{SSH public key}
    \item SSH public key source: \texttt{Use existing public key (create it before you created VM)}
    \item Public inbound ports: \texttt{HTTP(80), HTTPS(443), SSH(22)}
    \item OS disk type: \texttt{Standard SSD}
    \item Encryption type: \texttt{Default}
    \item Public IP: \texttt{Basic SKU, Static (be sure to create static IP)}
    \item Select inbound ports: \texttt{HTTP(80), HTTPS(443), SSH(22)}
    \item Boot diagnostics: \texttt{Disabled}
\end{itemize}
Chosen parameters of the virtual machine are collected in order to minimize vm's cost.
